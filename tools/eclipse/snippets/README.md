## Purpose
---
The purpose of this README file is to explain the purpose behind and (extreme) usefulness of using
snippets, sometimes called templates, during the development process. Snippets are any set of 
predefined code sets that can be instantly inserted into your own code, to help reduce the need
for repetitive tasks, such as constantly including the heading section of html document for example.

However reducing just repetitive task is really just the beginning of what snippets can provide for 
developers during the coding process. Snippets also provide the ability to dynamically add in your
own values before insertion, so you are not always just inserting just static content. Additionally
you can even set up snippets to behave similarly to other code editors such as Atom or Sublime to help
speed up the process of HTML insertions, some of this is hinted at with reviewing the
SMT-HTML-Snippets(refer to the snippet for example).

## How To Use
---
First you must import the provided snippets before you can begin to use, navigate to the
location where provided snippets are stored. Next in your eclipse ensure you have the
"Snippets" window view open, this where you will access of all of your snippets for use. If the
window is not already open, go to `Window-> Show view -> Other... -> Snippets`, alternatively 
you should be able to go to the "Quick Access" bar and just type out the view. Once your snippets
view is open, right click in the window and navigate down to customize and click it open, here you 
will find several options for use, the one we are concern with for now is the import command.
Click on it, then navigate to location of your provided snippets from earlier, here you will see
several [name]-snippets.xml files, you will want to import all provided snippets one by one.
After each snippets.xml file is import you will see each one listed back in your snippets view
in eclipse.

To use just right click on one of your choice and hit insert, if there are any dynamic fields 
to fill out a window will pop open for you to type in each custom value you want, some fields
may have defaults set to them already(you are not required in fill in this fields but if not 
data once inserted may not be completed). Afterwards the selected snippet will appear 
whichever currently selected editor window is open, that's it! That's all that is required to
add a snippet into your code.
